resolution_steps:
  - Eco-System provides SCI calculation
  - Architect proposes carbon mitigation (scheduling, efficiency, offsets)
  - If SCI reducible <50% → Accept with monitoring
  - If SCI remains >100% → Architect proposes alternative OR Economist justifies
  - If unresolvable after 3 iterations → Escalate

priority: 3  # Technical constraints

description: |
  Resolves tensions between compute-intensive technical solutions and
  carbon impact concerns. Evaluates mitigation strategies and alternative
  approaches to balance performance with sustainability.
