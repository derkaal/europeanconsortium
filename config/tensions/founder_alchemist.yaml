# Founder ↔ Alchemist Tension Protocol
protocol_id: founder_alchemist
name: "Revenue vs Brand Tension"
description: |
  The Founder wants to capture Feature Subsidies as immediate revenue.
  The Alchemist wants to build long-term brand premium from compliance.
  Both are valid - the question is resource allocation.

trigger_conditions:
  - Founder prioritizes short-term Feature Revenue
  - Alchemist prioritizes long-term Brand Investment
  - Resource constraint forces choice between them

resolution_procedure:
  1: "Founder quantifies Feature Revenue potential (€/year)"
  2: "Alchemist quantifies Brand Premium potential (€/year + moat value)"
  3: "Calculate: Is this a 'Revenue First' or 'Brand First' opportunity?"
  4: "If Feature Revenue > 3x Brand Investment: Founder approach"
  5: "If Brand Premium creates 5+ year moat: Alchemist approach"
  6: "If both significant: Hybrid (capture revenue, reinvest in brand)"

max_iterations: 2

escalation_trigger: |
  Cannot agree on resource allocation between
  immediate Feature capture vs long-term Brand building

synergy_note: |
  These agents should usually AGREE because their approaches stack:
  - Founder captures Feature Subsidy → Revenue
  - Alchemist converts compliance → Brand Premium
  - Combined: Revenue + Brand = Compound Advantage

  Tension only arises when resources are constrained.

resolution_outputs:
  revenue_first:
    description: "Prioritize immediate Feature Subsidy capture"
    conditions:
      - "Feature Revenue exceeds 3x brand investment cost"
      - "Market window is closing (18-24 months)"
      - "Cash flow needs are immediate"

  brand_first:
    description: "Prioritize long-term brand and moat building"
    conditions:
      - "Brand premium creates sustainable moat (5+ years)"
      - "Trust capital compounds over time"
      - "Regulatory arbitrage window is long-term"

  hybrid_strategy:
    description: "Capture Feature Revenue and reinvest in Brand"
    conditions:
      - "Both opportunities are significant"
      - "Revenue can fund brand investment"
      - "Feature and Brand are complementary"
    recommended: true

example_scenarios:
  scenario_1:
    context: "CSRD compliance for supply chain SaaS"
    founder_view: "Sell Scope 3 validation as Feature (€2M/year revenue)"
    alchemist_view: "Build 'CSRD-Native' brand positioning (10-15% premium)"
    resolution: "HYBRID - Capture CSRD revenue, use to fund brand marketing as 'First CSRD-Native Platform'"

  scenario_2:
    context: "AI Act transparency requirements"
    founder_view: "Sell 'Explainable AI as a Service' to incumbents (€5M/year)"
    alchemist_view: "Build 'AI Governance Platform' brand (market creation)"
    resolution: "HYBRID - Revenue from service funds platform development and branding"

  scenario_3:
    context: "Limited funding, must choose between carbon credits or GDPR premium"
    founder_view: "Carbon credits are €80/ton immediate revenue"
    alchemist_view: "GDPR brand creates 20% premium long-term"
    resolution: "REVENUE FIRST - Carbon credits fund operations, then invest in GDPR branding"
