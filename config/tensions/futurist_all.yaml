resolution_steps:
  - Futurist defines scenario matrix (2-4 key uncertainties)
  - All agents re-evaluate proposal under each scenario
  - Architect designs adaptation mechanisms
  - Calculate Weighted Scenario Robustness Score
  - Accept if strategy succeeds in >60% of probability-weighted scenarios

priority: 5  # Future scenarios

description: |
  Resolves tensions when Futurist identifies that a strategy fails in
  more than 50% of plausible future scenarios. Forces scenario-based
  evaluation and design of adaptation mechanisms to ensure strategic
  robustness across multiple possible futures.
