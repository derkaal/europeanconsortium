protocol_id: operator_strategy
agents:
  - operator
  - strategy

max_iterations: 2

trigger:
  operator_rating:
    - BLOCK
    - WARN
  operator_keywords:
    - timeline
    - execution
    - 2x
    - longer
    - unrealistic
    - implementation
    - duration

resolution_steps:
  - Operator provides detailed execution breakdown
  - Strategy agents choose (a) Revise timeline, (b) Reduce scope, (c) Increase resources
  - Economist re-evaluates ROI with realistic timeline
  - If revised timeline makes business case negative → Reject proposal

priority: 4  # Execution reality

  realistic assessment of implementation complexity and re-evaluation
  of business case with accurate timelines.
