query: "Should we move our automotive R&D data and simulation workloads to a US cloud provider?"

context:
  industry: "Automotive Manufacturing"
  company_size: "Large (50,000+ employees)"
  market: "Germany, primary EU operations"
  current_state: "On-premises HPC cluster for simulations, proprietary CAD data"
  constraints:
    - "Works council (Betriebsrat) must approve IT changes affecting workforce"
    - "Proprietary engine designs are trade secrets"
    - "Real-time collaboration with suppliers across EU"
    - "Cost pressure from board to reduce CAPEX"

expected_tensions:
  - agent_pair: ["sovereign", "economist"]
    reason: "Data sovereignty costs vs cloud economics"
  - agent_pair: ["ethnographer", "architect"]
    reason: "German consensus culture vs rapid cloud migration"
  - agent_pair: ["technologist", "economist"]
    reason: "Security controls increase costs"
  - agent_pair: ["jurist", "architect"]
    reason: "Trade secret protection vs cloud scalability"

expected_outcome_direction: |
  ACCEPT with conditions: European cloud provider (OVHcloud, Scaleway) or AWS EU with
  data sovereignty controls. Works council consultation required (6+ months). Budget
  for encryption and key management (€500K+). Phased migration starting with non-critical
  workloads. Trust premium positioning: "German Engineering, European Cloud."

test_specific_concerns:
  sovereign:
    - "US Cloud Act allows US government access to data"
    - "Trade secrets in foreign jurisdiction"
  economist:
    - "On-prem TCO: €10M/year vs cloud: €6-8M/year"
    - "CAPEX to OPEX transition attractive to CFO"
  ethnographer:
    - "German works council requires 6-month consultation"
    - "Engineering culture values control and precision"
  technologist:
    - "Encryption in use required for trade secrets"
    - "Key management must remain on-premises (HSM)"
  consumer_voice:
    - "Not directly applicable (B2B scenario)"
