  ACCEPT AWS with conditions: Use AWS EU regions with GDPR commitments. Implement
  encryption and access controls. Budget for potential migration (build abstraction layer).
  Position as "European fintech on global infrastructure." Re-evaluate at Series A when
  budget allows European alternatives.
