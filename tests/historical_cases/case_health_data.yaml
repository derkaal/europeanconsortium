query: "Should we build a pan-European health data platform for clinical research collaboration?"

context:
  industry: "Healthcare / Medical Research"
  company_size: "Consortium (15 hospitals, 5 research institutions)"
  market: "Pan-European (Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands, Poland)"
  current_state: "Fragmented data silos, limited cross-border research"
  constraints:
    - "GDPR Article 9: Special category data (health)"
    - "National health data regulations vary by country"
    - "Patient consent requirements differ across jurisdictions"
    - "Budget: €10M EU research grant"
    - "Must be operational in 24 months"

expected_tensions:
  - agent_pair: ["sovereign", "jurist"]
    reason: "Data sovereignty vs cross-border data sharing"
  - agent_pair: ["philosopher", "architect"]
    reason: "Patient privacy vs research utility"
  - agent_pair: ["ethnographer", "technologist"]
    reason: "National regulatory cultures vs unified platform"
  - agent_pair: ["ecosystem", "economist"]
    reason: "Sustainability requirements vs budget constraints"

expected_outcome_direction: |
  ACCEPT with federated architecture: Data stays in national jurisdictions, federated
  queries across borders. Differential privacy for aggregate statistics. Patient consent
  management per national law. European cloud provider (Ionos, OVHcloud) with data
  residency guarantees. Budget split: €6M technical, €2M compliance, €2M governance.

test_specific_concerns:
  sovereign:
    - "Health data cannot leave national borders (legal + political)"
    - "Federated learning: models travel, data stays"
  jurist:
    - "GDPR Article 9: Explicit consent required"
    - "EDPB Guidelines on health data processing"
    - "National variations: German strict, French centralized, Italian fragmented"
  philosopher:
    - "Patient autonomy: granular consent controls"
    - "Research benefit vs privacy risk trade-off"
    - "Secondary use of data requires renewed consent"
  architect:
    - "Federated architecture: query federation, not data centralization"
    - "Differential privacy for aggregate queries"
    - "Blockchain for consent audit trail (maybe)"
  ethnographer:
    - "German culture: patient skepticism of data sharing"
    - "French culture: state-led health data governance"
    - "Consensus-building across 5 national contexts"
  technologist:
    - "Encryption: end-to-end, zero-knowledge proofs"
    - "Access controls: role-based, attribute-based"
    - "Audit logs: immutable, regulators can review"
  ecosystem:
    - "Data center energy use: €500K/year"
    - "Renewable energy requirements for research grant"
  consumer_voice:
    - "Patient rights: access, rectification, erasure"
    - "Transparency: research purpose clearly communicated"
  economist:
    - "€10M budget: tight for 5-country platform"
    - "Open-source components reduce licensing costs"
